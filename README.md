# [FilterBird](https://betweenwalls.github.io/filterbird/)
Diablo II Filter Simulation (Path of Diablo & Project Diablo II)

### [Download](https://github.com/BetweenWalls/filterbird/archive/master.zip)

### Uses:
* Compare aesthetics of multiple filters
* Determine whether a filter shows what you're looking for
* Diagnose filter problems
* Discover which rules are responsible for displaying/hiding different items

### Notes:
This was originally made for Path of Diablo, and some features may still reflect that for the PD2 version:
* Unique/Set/Runeword item stats and item corruptions are from PoD
* Skill charges were never fully implemented, so no items can be selected that would match on "CHSK" codes
* "FOOLS" code unimplemented
* Notifications & minimap icons unimplemented

### Future Goals:
* Allow multiple items to be viewed simultaneously
* Create option to generate variety of different items so filters can be compared effectively with just a few clicks
* Allow any number of filters to be compared simultaneously
* Make item tooltips better match in-game tooltips
