### [Download](https://github.com/BetweenWalls/filterbird/archive/master.zip)

### Uses:
* Compare aesthetics of multiple filters
* Determine whether a filter shows what you're looking for
* Diagnose filter problems
* Discover how many rules are processed to display different items

### Future Goals:
* Allow multiple items to be viewed simultaneously
* Create option to generate variety of different items so filters can be compared effectively with just a few clicks
* Allow any number of filters to be compared simultaneously
* Character Customization (only CLVL can be adjusted so far)
* Make item tooltips better match in-game tooltips
